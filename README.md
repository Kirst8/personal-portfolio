About Me
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kirstin Brooker, and I'm thrilled to share a bit about myself with you.

Background
For the past 4 years, I've had the incredible privilege of working as a nanny, helping families create nurturing environments for their children. It's been a rewarding journey filled with moments of joy, learning, and growth. My role as a nanny has taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and adaptability. These skills, I believe, will serve as a strong foundation as I embark on a new adventure in the world of technology.

Transition to Tech
While I've enjoyed my time as a nanny, I've always had a deep curiosity about the tech industry. The dynamic nature of technology and its potential to shape the future have always fascinated me. I've spent my spare time exploring various aspects of technology, from coding to understanding the latest fintech innovations.

Interest in Fintech
One area that particularly excites me is financial technology, or fintech. The intersection of finance and technology has the power to revolutionize the way we manage money, make investments, and plan for our financial futures. I'm eager to contribute to this exciting field by leveraging my skills and experiences.

GitHub Journey
I've created this GitHub repository as a way to document my journey into the tech world. Here, you'll find my projects, experiments, and learning resources. I'm passionate about continuous learning and growth, and I'm excited to share my progress with the GitHub community.
